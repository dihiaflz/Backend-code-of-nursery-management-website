2. Run the command **npm install** to install all the project's dependencies
3. Create in the project's root directory a .env file
4. Create a new database in mongodb and find the link to connect your db ( sign in in mongodb website => database => connect => mongodb for vs code )
5. Fill out the **.env** file with the following informations : DATABASE_URI= the link to use your db, SECRET= the secret for your jwt token, it can be any word you want but you should keep it a secret
